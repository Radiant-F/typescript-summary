// What is TypeScript
TypeScript is a programming language to address shortcomings of JavaScript.
Every JavaScript file is a valid TypeScript file.
TypeScript is essentially JavaScript with type checking.
In TypeScript we explicitly set the type of our variables upon declaration 

// TypeScript Beneftis:
1. Static typing
2. Code completion
3. Refactoring
4. Shorthand notation

// Static typing example
== Statically-typed (C++, C#, Java)
int number = 10;
number = "a"; <-- ERROR
== Dynamically-typed
let number = 10;
number = "a"; <-- WORKS
Math.random(number); <-- THE PROBLEM

// Built-In Types
any
unknown
never
enum
tuple

// tuple
Tuple is a fixed length array where each element has a particular type.

// enum
Enum represents a list of related constants
const enum Size {Small, Medium, Large}
