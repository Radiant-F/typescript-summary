// What is TypeScript
TypeScript is a programming language to address shortcomings of JavaScript.
Every JavaScript file is a valid TypeScript file.
TypeScript is essentially JavaScript with type checking.
In TypeScript we explicitly set the type of our variables upon declaration 

// TypeScript Beneftis:
1. Static typing
2. Code completion
3. Refactoring
4. Shorthand notation

// Static typing example
== Statically-typed (C++, C#, Java)
int number = 10;
number = "a"; <-- ERROR
== Dynamically-typed
let number = 10;
number = "a"; <-- WORKS
Math.random(number); <-- THE PROBLEM

// Built-In Types
any
unknown
never
enum
tuple

== tuple
Tuple is a fixed length array where each element has a particular type.

== enum
Enum represents a list of related constants
const enum Size {Small, Medium, Large}

// Advanced Types
== Type Aliases
Define a custom shape. Make object reusable with different value. Don't repeat yourself.
The other object might have other properties. Some object might not have a consistent shape, because we don't have a single place to define the shape of an object.
Making the code easy to read.

== Union Types
With union type, we can give a variable or a function parameter more than one type

== Intersection Types
